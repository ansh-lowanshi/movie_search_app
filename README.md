# Flutter Movie Search App

This is a responsive movie search application built with Flutter, using the TMDb API. This project was completed as part of the Flutter Internship Assignment for Glowbal Network.

* **Movie Search**: Search for movies in real-time using the TMDb API.
* **State Management**: Built with BLoC/Cubit for predictable and robust state management.
* **Responsive UI**: The layout fluidly adapts to different screen sizes and orientations (phones, tablets, portrait, and landscape).
* **API Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network errors and API failures.
* **Secure API Keys**: Uses a `.env` file to keep API keys secure and out of version control.
